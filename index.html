                <article id="about-me">I am Prangon Ghose. I am 24 years old and from Bangladesh. I have recently completed my Bachelor of Science in 
                    Engineering in Nuclear Science & Engineering from Military Institute of Science  & Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
                    Life has taught me that learning is a continuous process. I have understood deeply - "The more
                    I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know." That is why I am eager to give tremendous effort to whatever I 
                    learn. Learning new concepts and solving problems have always been my passion. I have never achieved anything 
                    extraordinary. But I try to be consistent towards acquiring in - depth knowledge in every new sector of learning.
                    I always prefer to be working with a team as there are more brains working on the same problem which creates not only
                    a flow of invaluable information but also different approaches towards the problem. I am thankful to the Almighty 
                    for whatever I have, for whoever I am. And I will always be grateful to my parents for their support and love for me.

                        <strong>Ceremony: </strong>Nuclear Festival of Military Institute of Science & Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh<br>
                        <strong>Abstract</strong>
                        <p>
                            Using nuclear radiation and nuclear energy in various sectors of science has become a well-known tradition. 
                            But before executing anything we need to think about the safety measures first. Radiation and nuclear 
                            terrorism has become one of the major problems of the present world. Other than this radiation is the most 
                            important and prominent issue in modern age because it threatens human health and causes damages to 
                            electrical and software systems. Several studies have demonstrated the potential cancer, cardiovascular, and 
                            musculoskeletal impact radiation. As a result need of a more accurate, less harmful and less expensive 
                            shielding material is gradually increasing. That led us to our current study. In most of the cases Lead (Pb) 
                            is being used as an ideal shielding material. One of the sources for that is NCRP Report No. 34 - Medical 
                            X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Protection for Energies up to 10 MeV - Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation. But 
                            it has significant problems such as being extremely expensive, having toxic effects and failing in neutron 
                            shielding. Neutron is the most hazardous particle among other radiation types. Keeping all these in mind, 
                            we have tried to figure out a novel, non-toxic, inexpensive shielding material which can be used for 
                            shielding against both gamma radiation and neutron radiation. Initially Sodium penta-borate is synthesized. 
                            The reason of selecting Sodium penta-borate is that, from experiments done with this material to look upon 
                            its shielding ability it can be said that, sodium pent borate is a novel neutron shielding material 
                            outstandingly. The fabric which contains only 230 g of Sodium Penta-borate has reached 75.21% absorption 
                            rate of neutron. But it is not an ideal shielding material against gamma-rays. Therefore Sodium penta-borate
                            and Barium Sulphate have been used in a combination so that a novel shielding material can be produced against 
                            both neutron radiation and gamma rays. From further experiments done with this shielding material has shown 
                            the result that this has given a respectively better performance against gamma and neutron radiation. 
                            Interior material of shelter, nuclear protective clothing, space shuttle and aircraft radiation shielding 
                            paints can be produced with this material. It should be emphasized that, radiation experiments with Sodium 
                            Penta borate is a novel implementation in the world to the best of our literature knowledge.

                            aerial vehicle will also work as an early detection system in case 
                            of any nuclear accident and thus save lives. This unmanned 
                            aerial vehicle has been equipped with a Geiger - Müller (GM)
                            counter to measure background radiation of an area in counts 
                            per minute and a memory module for storing the measured 
                            counts. It is capable of flight along a predetermined route without 
                            any intervention and can also be controlled from a range of 
                            about 1.5 km using transmitter. It can also measure height using 
                            a preinstalled barometer and has been used to measure counts per 
                            minute in air in Dhaka city as a proof of concept.

                        <strong>Project on "Radiological Environmental Surveillance using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in Mirpur Cantonment, Dhaka"</strong><br>
                        <strong>Location: </strong>Military Institute of Science & Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh<br>
                        <strong>Abstract</strong>
                        <p>
                            In this project, we assembled and demonstrated an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which was 
                            used to conduct a radiological environmental surveillance using a Geiger - Muller (GM) counter. 
                            To ensure environmental protection and enhancing nuclear safety, routine surveillance of 
                            radioactivity is a must. Biggest challenge in conducting frequent radiological environmental 
                            surveillance is limiting the exposure of the radiation workers. Using remotely controlled and 
                            automated robotics (e.g. UAV) can overcome this challenge. It also comes with the added benefit 
                            of requiring much less time while surveying a vast area. The UAV flies along a predetermined 
                            route or is remotely controlled while collecting radioactivity data using GM counter in counts per 
                            minute (cpm). The data is stored in an SD card which is later extracted for analysis. The assembled 
                            GM counter is 96% efficient in measuring gamma radiation. The surveillance conducted on Mirpur 
                            Cantonment, Dhaka shows the average absorbed dose is 2.155 mSv/year.

                        <strong>Abstract</strong>
                        <p>
                            In this study, we analyzed Gold (Au), Silver (Ag), Gadolinium (Gd) nanoparticles as dose 
                            enhancing agents in brachytherapy using Monte Carlo simulation. In brachytherapy, it is 
                            vital that the tumor cells receive absorbed dose as high as possible while minimizing dose 
                            received by the adjacent healthy cells. This can be achieved by injecting metals with high 
                            atomic number as nanoparticles into the tumor. When gamma ray released by the 
                            brachytherapy seed interacts with the nanoparticles due to the high electron density, 
                            photoelectric effect takes place. The secondary directly ionizing radiation thus produced 
                            increases absorbed dose in the tumor cells while the healthy cells receive a lower dose. In 
                            this study OpenMC was used for the overall simulation over realistic model of human eye. 
                            Simulation was run for various volume fractions of nanoparticles inside a tumor using 
                            realistic human eye model. OpenMC is unable to calculate absorbed dose directly and so 
                            the hand calculation was done partially to approximate dose and dose rate. There are several 
                            parameters which govern the outcome of the dose enhancement in presence of metallic 
                            nanoparticles. Absorbed reaction rate, photoelectric reaction rate, scattering reaction rate, 
                            heating rate and pair production reaction rate are such parameters which affects dose 
                            enhancement significantly. This study describes these parameters explicitly. Parameters 
                            governing dose enhancement in tissues were scored in the simulation which prove the 
                            validity of the concept. Gold was found the best dose enhancer at 3% volume of the tumor 
                            cell.
